description: 'Coaching is a conversation or narrative that can transform individuals and organizations. We are always talking to our selves. We are either talking ourselves into or out of taking some action to accomplish a desired state or result. The question is, as the possible future emerges what voices will determine the horizon you or your organizations will inherit?'
